1.Purpose of EDA: 
To summarize, understand, and uncover patterns, anomalies, or relationships in data before modeling.

2.Boxplots in understanding a dataset: 
Boxplots visualize distribution, median, quartiles, and outliers, helping identify variability and anomalies.

3.Correlation and its usefulness: 
Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between variables; it helps identify related features for analysis or modeling.

4.Detecting skewness in data: 
Skewness is detected using statistics (skew() in Python) or visually via histograms and density plots. Positive skew = right tail, negative skew = left tail.

5. Multicollinearity: 
Occurs when independent variables are highly correlated, which can distort regression estimates and reduce model interpretability.

6.Tools for EDA: 
Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and tools like Jupyter Notebook or Tableau for visualization.

7. Example of EDA finding a problem:
EDA revealed missing values in the Age column and extreme fare outliers in Titanic data, which guided data cleaning before modeling.

8. Role of visualization in ML: 
Visualization helps understand patterns, detect anomalies, communicate insights, and support feature selection for machine learning models.
